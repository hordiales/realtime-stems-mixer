# 🧠 Smart Loading SuperCollider Stem Mixer Guide

## Overview

The Smart Loading SuperCollider Stem Mixer (`supercollider_stem_mixer_smart.py`) is an intelligent real-time audio mixing system designed for Eurovision song stems. It uses **smart loading** to only load audio stems when they're actually playing, making it perfect for systems with memory constraints (like your 16GB system).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start SuperCollider Audio Server

First, start the minimal memory SuperCollider server:

```supercollider
// In SuperCollider IDE
"supercollider_audio_server_minimal.scd".loadRelative;
```

Wait for this message: `✅ Server booted successfully with minimal memory!`

### 2. Run the Smart Mixer

```bash
/Users/hordia/miniconda3/envs/UBA-crowdstream/bin/python supercollider_stem_mixer_smart.py
```

## 🎛️ Command Interface

### Basic Controls

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `bpm <value>` | Set global BPM (60-200) | `bpm 128` |
| `cross <0-1>` | Crossfade between decks | `cross 0.5` |
| `songs` | List all available songs | `songs` |
| `status` | Show mixer status | `status` |
| `memory` | Request SuperCollider memory status | `memory` |
| `cleanup` | Free unused memory | `cleanup` |

| `b.<stem> <song>` | Load stem to Deck B | `b.vocals 5` |
| `a.<stem>.<section> <song>` | Load stem from specific section | `a.drums.chorus 3` |
| `b.<stem>.<section> <song>` | Load stem from specific section | `b.bass.verse 1` |

**Available stems:** `bass`, `drums`, `vocals`, `piano`, `other`

### Volume Controls

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `bass <0-1>` | Set bass volume across both decks | `bass 0.8` |
| `drums <0-1>` | Set drums volume | `drums 0.6` |
| `vocals <0-1>` | Set vocals volume | `vocals 0.9` |
| `piano <0-1>` | Set piano volume | `piano 0.4` |
| `other <0-1>` | Set other instruments volume | `other 0.5` |

### Advanced Features

## 🎛️ Example Mixing Session

### 1. Create a Mix

Load different stems from different songs:

```bash
# Load bass from song 0, drums from song 2
🎛️🧠 > a.bass 0
📥 Smart loading: bass from Sweden Loreen Tattoo → buffer 1000
▶️  Smart playing: buffer 1000 (rate: 0.98)

🎛️🧠 > a.drums 2  
📥 Smart loading: drums from Ukraine Tvorchi Heart Of Steel → buffer 1001
▶️  Smart playing: buffer 1001 (rate: 1.07)
```

### 2. Load Specific Sections

```bash
# Load vocals from chorus of song 1
🎛️🧠 > b.vocals.chorus 1
📥 Smart loading: vocals_chorus from Finland Kaarija Cha Cha Cha → buffer 1002
▶️  Smart playing: buffer 1002 from 32.3s [chorus] (rate: 0.93)
```

### 3. Adjust Mix

```bash
# Set volumes
🎛️🧠 > bass 0.7
🔊 Bass volume: 0.70

🎛️🧠 > vocals 0.9
🔊 Vocals volume: 0.90

# Crossfade between decks
🎛️🧠 > cross 0.3
🎚️  Crossfade: 0.30
```

### 4. Change BPM

```bash
🎛️🧠 > bpm 140
🎵 BPM: 140.0
▶️  Smart playing: buffer 1000 (rate: 1.08)  # Automatically adjusts
```

## 💾 Smart Memory Management

### How Smart Loading Works

1. **Only loads when playing:** Audio files are only loaded into SuperCollider when you actually play them
2. **Automatic cleanup:** Old stems are automatically freed when replaced
3. **Memory monitoring:** Use `memory` and `cleanup` commands to monitor usage

### Memory Commands

```bash
# Check memory usage
🎛️🧠 > memory
📊 Requested memory status from SuperCollider

# Manual cleanup (happens automatically)
🎛️🧠 > cleanup  
🧹 Requested memory cleanup from SuperCollider
```

### Status Monitoring

```bash
🎛️🧠 > status

🎛️🧠 SMART LOADING STEM MIXER STATUS
==================================================
🎵 BPM: 140.0
🎚️  Crossfade: 0.30
🔊 Master Volume: 0.80

💾 Memory Status:
  Loaded buffers: 3
  Playing stems: 3

🎵 DECK A:
  bass: Sweden Loreen Tattoo (buffer: 1000)
  drums: Ukraine Tvorchi Heart Of Steel (buffer: 1001)

🎵 DECK B:
  vocals: Finland Kaarija Cha Cha Cha [chorus] (buffer: 1002)
```

## 🎲 Random Mode

Generate instant creative mixes:

```bash
🎛️🧠 > random
🎲 Random smart mix: BPM 127
📥 Smart loading: bass from Spain Blanca Paloma Eaea → buffer 1003
📥 Smart loading: drums_verse from Sweden Loreen Tattoo → buffer 1004
📥 Smart loading: vocals_chorus from Finland Kaarija Cha Cha Cha → buffer 1005
...
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Mixer Config (`mixer_config.json`)

The smart mixer uses the same configuration as other mixers:

```json
{
  "audio": {
    "sample_rate": 48000,
    "buffer_size": 512,
    "master_volume": 0.8
  },
  "mixing": {
    "stem_volumes": {
      "bass": 0.8,
      "drums": 0.7,
      "vocals": 0.9,
      "piano": 0.6,
      "other": 0.5
    }
  },
  "osc": {
    "enable_osc": true,
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5005
  }
}
```

## 📡 OSC Control

External OSC control is available on port 5005:

```python
# Example OSC messages
/bpm 128.0
/crossfade 0.5
/stem/bass 0.8
/random
/status
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### SuperCollider Won't Boot

```bash
# Try even smaller memory in SuperCollider:
s.options.memSize = 2.pow(16);  // 64MB only
s.reboot;
"supercollider_audio_server_minimal.scd".loadRelative;
```

### Audio Issues

1. **No sound:** Check that SuperCollider server is running
2. **Crackling:** Try increasing SuperCollider's buffer size
3. **Memory errors:** Use `cleanup` command or restart SuperCollider

### Missing Songs

1. Ensure stems are in `stems/` directory
2. Each song needs a subdirectory with stem files: `bass.wav`, `drums.wav`, etc.
3. Song structures should be in `song-structures/` as JSON files

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Memory Efficient:** Only loads what's playing (perfect for 16GB systems)
2. **Individual Stems:** Mix bass from one song with drums from another
3. **Section-Based:** Play specific parts (verse, chorus, bridge, etc.)
4. **Real-time:** Instant BPM and pitch adjustments
5. **Smart Cleanup:** Automatic memory management
6. **Visual Feedback:** Clear status and loading information

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Create Complex Mixes

```bash
# Progressive house build-up
🎛️🧠 > bpm 128
🎛️🧠 > a.bass.intro 0      # Start with bass intro
🎛️🧠 > a.drums.verse 1     # Add different drums
🎛️🧠 > b.vocals.chorus 2   # Prepare vocals on B
🎛️🧠 > cross 0.0           # Only A playing
🎛️🧠 > cross 0.5           # Blend in vocals
🎛️🧠 > b.piano.bridge 3    # Add piano bridge
```

### Live Performance

```bash
# Quick performance commands
🎛️🧠 > random             # Instant creative mix
🎛️🧠 > bpm 140           # Speed up
🎛️🧠 > vocals 0.0        # Drop vocals
🎛️🧠 > drums 1.0         # Full drums
🎛️🧠 > cross 1.0         # Switch to B deck
```

This smart loading approach gives you maximum creative control while being gentle on your system's memory!
